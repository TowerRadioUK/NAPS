# NAPS
Navidrome (and) Azuracast Playlist Synchronization

## What is NAPS?
NAPS is a script to automate playlist creation through Navidrome to Azuracast.

## Why does NAPS exist?
Navidrome offers a more friendlier interface for our production team to create playlists with. This means that the playlists created via Navidrome need to be synced to Azuracast in order to be used with their Liquidsoap AutoDJ service.
